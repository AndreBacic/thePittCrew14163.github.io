      <h3>Out reach</h3>
<p>The Pitt Crew has told many people about FIRST. We went to a local school and showed our robot <br> to the kids who were inspired to participate in FIRST. We demonstrated our robot at a fair where <br> 500+ people possily saw our robot. We held a yard sale where we raised money for our team and <br> told people about FIRST. And those are just a few of the places we've told people about FIRST!  </p>

		<h4>Fairs</h4>
      <p>We have gone to many fairs. At each one we've gone to we set up a booth displaying our robot, information about FIRST etc... We were able to answer people's questions about our team and FTC. Overall we told many people about how and why to participate in FIRST.</p>

      <h4>Videos&nbsp;</h4>
      <p>The Pitt Crew has also made videos about FIRST. We won first place for making the best video responding to a FIRST related promt at a tournament we attended our first year! We made a similar video the next year and look to make videos helping other teams with common problems we've encountered. </p>

		<h4>Schools</h4>
      <p>The Pitt Crew even went to a school to display our robot. The elemantary school students were very fascinated by the robot. We learned later that the kids actually wanted to start a robotics team with FIST becouse of their experience. The robot inspired them to persue robotics </p>
